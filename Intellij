when you open a new project by openning the related folder, if the maven project is not detected:
ctrl + shift + A -> in actions search for "Add Framework Support..."
then from there select Maven
and that's it!

Better way:
ctrl + shift + A -> in actions search for "Reload All Maven Projects"

Tip:
When dependencies are not updated successfully in IntelliJ, especially on Linux, delete the local maven repository or run the following command:
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository
