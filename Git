Git log:
git log --oneline --all --graph

Git update:
git fetch and then git merge, or git pull --no-rebase
git fetch and then git rebase, or git pull --rebase

if you want to add your changes on the feature branch to the top of changes that you get from master after upating master:
run 'git rebase master' on feature branch so your changes will be added to the top of changes from master and you know about the possible conflicts

Discard changes made to the files in the current working directory and revert them back to the last committed state:
git checkout .
